# NoDeathAnimations
Removes entity tilt and fall over death animation. Similar to the Tweakeroo feature in the DISABLE menu. Motivation was to have this feature in a standalone mod that is fair play for multiplayer. Does not disable targeting dead entities, which is considered an unfair advantage.

Requires [owolib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/owo-lib), used for configuration and ModMenu integration.
